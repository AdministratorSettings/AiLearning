1. The system should store the publicly known hash100 value "aa763a77446adb1b8a79f78b770354a8".
2. The system should require users to authenticate using their password before granting access to privileged functions.
3. When a user authenticates with their password, the system should hash the password using the MD5 algorithm 100 times to obtain a new hash value.
4. The system should then compare this new hash value with the publicly known hash100 value.
5. If the values match, the system should grant the user access to the privileged functions.
6. If the values do not match, the system should deny access and prompt the user to try again or reset their password if necessary.
7. If the user needs to prove ownership of the password without disclosing it, they can provide other pieces of the hash chain, such as hash95.
8. To demonstrate ownership, the user can calculate 5xMD5(hash95) and provide the resulting value to the system. If the value matches hash100, it suggests that the user has knowledge of the original password and can be granted access to the privileged functions.
9. It's important to ensure that the other pieces of the hash chain, such as hash95, are kept confidential and only known to the password owner, to prevent unauthorized access.
